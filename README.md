# space-bag-rs
Too much stuff, not enough space.

Did you know that your files have space in them? 
Thats right! Every file is made of binary, which are ones and zeroes. 
Imagine how much space is wasted by all those empty zeroes!
Have you ever wished you could remove all that pesky space from your files? 
Well, you're in luck!
This program vacuums out all the empty space so that you can fit more files on your computer! Wow!

## How it works
All files are binary and binary is composed of ones and zeroes. 
This program converts files from binary (base 2) into base 1. 
Yes, this is a joke. 
Yes, this is horrible.
I also used a naiive implementation since I found it unlikely anyone would use this on medium-to-large files.

## Obligatory Warning
If you didn't understand the ramifactions of the "How it Works" section here's an explicit warning: Please don't use this on a file larger than 4 bytes.
